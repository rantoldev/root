# TERM - Privacy-Focused Anon Chat

TERM is a Matrix-inspired, privacy-focused terminal interface for the $TERM token ecosystem. It combines cutting-edge crypto integrations with a premium cyberpunk aesthetic to provide an immersive monitoring and interaction experience.

## The Matrix View

The **Matrix View** is the heart of the TERM interface, designed to transport users into a high-fidelity digital simulation. It is not just a dashboard; it is an immersive experience that features:

- **Dynamic Matrix Rain**: A custom-built, high-performance canvas background that renders the iconic falling green code, setting the stage for the Matrix theme.
- **CRT Overlay & Vignette**: Strategic CSS filters and overlays that recreate the nostalgia of vintage cathode-ray tube terminals, including scanlines and subtle flickering.
- **Glitch & Neon Aesthetics**: Responsive glitch text effects and neon glows that react to user interactions, emphasizing the "reality-breaching" theme.
- **Immersive Narrative**: An asynchronous typing system that delivers messages with a "human-like" cadence, guiding the user through the system's initialization and story.
- **Interactive Terminal**: A suite of command-line tools (`./take_red_pill`, `./hack_contract`, `./consult_oracle`) that allow users to interact with the $TERM ecosystem through a thematic lens.

Whether you're monitoring contract data via Helius or tracking $TERM on Pump.fun, the Matrix View ensures you do it from within the simulation.
